    <p>
    The World Wide Web (also known as WWW, W3, or simply the Web) is an information system that enables content sharing over the Internet using a graphical user interface. <br>
    It facilitates access to documents and other web resources according to specific rules of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br>
    The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1993. <br>
    It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".<br>
