    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript (JS) is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. <br>
        It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995. As of 2025, the overwhelming majority of websites (98.9%) uses JavaScript for client side webpage behavior. <br>
        Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. <br>
        These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. <br>
        The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.<br>
